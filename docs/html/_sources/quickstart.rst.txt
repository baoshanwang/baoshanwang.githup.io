Quickstart
==========

After you install the collection outlined in the  `installation`_ guide, you
can access the collection and the ansible-doc covered in the following topics:

.. _installation:
   installation.html

sm
------------

After the collection is installed, you can access the collection content for a
playbook by referencing the namespace ``inspur`` and the collection's fully
qualified name ``sm``. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  -hosts: ism
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    ism:
      host: "{{ ansible_ssh_host }}"
      username: "{{ username }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"

  tasks:

  - name: "Get user information"
    inspur.sm.user_info:
      provider: "{{ ism }}"


In Ansible 2.9, the ``collections`` keyword was added to reduce the need
to refer to the collection repeatedly. For example, you can use the
``collections`` keyword in your playbook:

.. code-block:: yaml

  -hosts: ism
  collections:
    - isnpur.sm
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    ism:
      host: "{{ ansible_ssh_host }}"
      username: "{{ username }}"
      password: "{{ password }}"

  tasks:

  - name: "Get user information"
    user_info:
      provider: "{{ ism }}"


ansible-doc
-----------

Modules included in this collection provide additional documentation that is
similar to a UNIX, or UNIX-like operating system man page (manual page). This
documentation can be accessed from the command line by using the
``ansible-doc`` command.

Here's how to use the ``ansible-doc`` command after you install the
**Inspur sm collection**: ``ansible-doc inspur.sm.user_info``

.. code-block:: sh

	> USER_INFO    (/root/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/inspur/sm/plugins/modules/user_info.py)

			Get user information on Inspur server.
